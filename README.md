# Watch With Friends
**Watch with friends** is a project which main goal is to create place in which friends can "meet together" to watch movies in the era of a pandemic. My task was to allow as many friends as possible to connect at the same time in one room. In this room, users  can manage the currently broadcasting YouTube video, paste a link to the selected movie, stop and play the movie freely. A chat will be added as an additional element of the room, which will allow real-time communication between website users.
